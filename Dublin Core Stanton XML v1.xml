    <dc:description>In 1895, Elizabeth Cady Stanton published the first edition of "The Woman's Bible," an attempt to amplify, explain, and redefine scriptural references pertaining to women in the basis that these were often used as a rationale to deny women particular rights and privileges. The work was undertaken by a committee and involved searching the both Old and New Testaments for references to women, cutting them out, and then pasting them on blank pages in a book. Then commentaries were added beneath the quotations. In 1898, "The Woman's Bible" was reprinted, including the addition of a 20-page pamphlet entitled, "Bible and Church Degrade Woman," which contained three essays by Stanton that further explained her position on women in religion. This is one of those essays.</dc:description>
