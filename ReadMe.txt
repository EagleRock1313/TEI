These files are the source and output HTML from my final project for XML INFO 246 class Fall 2015.  
We were required to create a TEI level 4 project and transform the output with
XSLT to HTML.  I chose to crosswalk 3 SGML files to TEI.  
These 3 files were from the Constitution of the National Women's Suffrage Association.

A video of the project is here (12:03)

Copy of assignment instructions:

1st XSLT : TEI Presentation
The first XSLT should work with any of your TEI XML files. The entire transcription of each of your documents must be displayed on the resulting HTML page. (1 HTML page TEI document.) All the markup in your XML files should be expressed in the HTML as well. Your XSLT should display your documents in a manner that matches the traditional representation of that type of a document. In other words, a poem should look like a poem, and a letter should look like a letter.

2nd XSLT : Dublin Core (DC) Presentation
The second XSLT should work with any of your DC XML files. The goal is to create a full record display on the web for each of the DC records you create. We would like layout, color, and font formatting (bold, italics, etc.) to make the records easy to read. You have experience from your earlier assignments in using a table to display can use a similar display, or try something different. Here's an example of a basic presentation of a DC record that would satisfy the assignment.
